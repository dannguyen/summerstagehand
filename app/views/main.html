				<h4>About</h4>
				<p>
					<strong>STAGEORAMA</strong> was built by Dan Nguyen of Skift for the
					<a href="http://hacksummerstage.com/">2013 Hack SummerStage Challenge</a>. 

					It is not officially endorsed by the
					New York City Parks Foundation nor the SummerStageTK
				</p>

	  			<img src="/images/stageorama.jpg" alt="SummerStage">
	        </a>
			</div>



				<p>
					The main reason I made this app was because I wanted a faster way to
					look at the listings. Also, I don't know all of the musicians, so I wanted
					a way to preview their work. <a href="/#/videos">STAGEORAMA has more than 100 hand-curated</a>
					videos from participatin acts.
				</p>
				<p>
					The second reason for this app was because I wanted to win the HackSummerStage
					Challenge. There's no cash prize, but one of the TKperks is that
					the winner will be "<em>acknowledged in stage announcements at every SummerStage show</em>,"
					which means maybe someone will pronounce my last name, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32wBZwWFGT4">possibly like this</a>.

				</p>
				<p>
					So if you find this app useful, please consider voting for it in the Hack SummerStage Challenge.
					If you have any questions/complaints, feel free to contact me on Twitter at @dancow or at my blog
